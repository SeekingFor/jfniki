=About=

jFniki is an uncensorable, decentralized, pseudo-anonymous
wiki implementation which runs on top of Freenet
and FMS or Freetalk.

Bear in mind that jFniki was designed to run as a
standalone web application -- and still does. This plugin
is a thin wrapper around that code. It may not always
behave like other plugins. Specifically:

# It has modal UI states which you will see regardless of
path until you exit them. e.g. the ##Configuration## page
# It doesn't support sessions. Everyone who has access to your
fproxy port will see the same thing.
# It doesn't save any configuration state so you will need to
re-import your configuration every time you load the plugin.
