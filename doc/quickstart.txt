//You are seeing this Quick Start because the wiki has no Front_Page. It will disappear as soon as you edit and save the page. //
----

== Quick Start ==

===Configuration===
# Click on the "View" link below to view (and edit) the configuration. \\
  //Hint: Open the "View" link in a separate tab or window.//
# Set the "FMS Name" to the human readable part of your FMS ID (everything before the '@').
# Set the FMS Private SSK to your private FMS SSK (see below if you don't know how to find this).
# Adjust any other values as necessary.  If you're running FMS and Fred on the same machine on the default ports this shouldn't be necessary.
# Click the "Done" button to save the configuration changes.

=== Finding Other Versions Of the testwiki===
Click the "Discover" link below to search for other versions of the wiki.

If you don't see anything read the  "FMS configuration" section below.

=== Submitting ===
Use the "Submit" link below to submit your changes.  It may take a long time for other people to see them.

=== There are other wikis! ===
With the default settings you load the "testwiki" I have been using for testing.

There are other wikis out there.

Try entering "freenetdocwiki" in for the "Wiki Name" on the configuration page, then doing "Discover".

=== Known Limitations ===
# There is no merging or rebasing (yet).
# The only way to start an empty wiki from scratch is by loading and unloading the plugin (or running stand alone from the command line).

----
=== Finding Your Private SSK ===
# Go to http://127.0.0.1:18080/localidentities.htm in the FMS web interface and click the "Export Identities" button
to save your FMS indentities to a file.
# In the text editor of your choice, open the file you saved above and look for the Name and PrivateKey values for the identity you want to use.

In the example identity snippet below, the FMS Name value would be:\\
SomeUser

and the FMS Private Key would be: \\
SSK@YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,AQECAAE/

----
{{{
<Identity>
   <Name><![CDATA[SomeUser]]></Name>
   <PublicKey>SSK@XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,AQACAAE/</PublicKey>
   <PrivateKey>SSK@YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,AQECAAE/</PrivateKey>
   <SingleUse>false</SingleUse>
   <PublishTrustList>false</PublishTrustList>
   <PublishBoardList>false</PublishBoardList>
   <PublishFreesite>false</PublishFreesite>
</Identity>
}}}

===FMS Configuration===

By default the prototype uses the "biss.test000" FMS group.
Make sure FMS is configured to save messages to this group.

On the FMS Boards maintenance page:
http://127.0.0.1:18080/boards.htm

Search for "biss.test000" and make sure "Save Received Messages" is checked.

If you can't find the group, add it.
