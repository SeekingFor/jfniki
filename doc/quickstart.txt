== Quick Start ==

jfniki can be configured to either use FMS or Freetalk, but not both at the same time.

===Configuration for FMS===
# Click on the "View" link below to view (and edit) the configuration. \\
  //Hint: Open the "View" link in a separate tab or window.//
# Set the "FMS Name" to the human readable part of your FMS ID (everything before the '@').
# Set the FMS Private SSK to your private FMS SSK (see below if you don't know how to find this).
# Adjust any other values as necessary.  If you're running FMS and Fred on the same machine on the default ports this shouldn't be necessary.
# Click the "Done" button to save the configuration changes.

===Configuration for Freetalk===
Same as configuring for FMS, except read "Freetalk" any time you see "FMS".
# Change the "FMS Port" to 1199, which is Freetalk's default port
# Set the "FMS Name" to your full Freetalk identity as shown at the top of the Freetalk => Identities page.
# Change the "FMS Group" from "biss.test000" to "mul.biss.test000"

=== Finding Other Versions Of the testwiki===
Click the "Discover" link below to search for other versions of the wiki.

If you don't see anything read the  "FMS configuration" section below.

=== Submitting ===
Use the "Submit" link below to submit your changes.  It may take a long time for other people to see them.

=== There are other wikis! ===
With the default settings you load the "testwiki" I have been using for testing.

There are other wikis out there.

Try entering "freenetdocwiki" in for the "Wiki Name" on the configuration page, then doing "Discover".

=== Known Limitations ===
# There is no merging or rebasing (yet).
# The only way to start an empty wiki from scratch is by loading and unloading the plugin (or running stand alone from the command line).

----
=== Finding Your Private SSK in FMS===
# Go to http://127.0.0.1:18080/localidentities.htm in the FMS web interface and click the "Export Identities" button
to save your FMS indentities to a file.
# In the text editor of your choice, open the file you saved above and look for the Name and PrivateKey values for the identity you want to use.

In the example identity snippet below, the FMS Name value would be:\\
SomeUser

and the FMS Private Key would be: \\
SSK@YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,AQECAAE/

----
{{{
<Identity>
   <Name><![CDATA[SomeUser]]></Name>
   <PublicKey>SSK@XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,AQACAAE/</PublicKey>
   <PrivateKey>SSK@YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,AQECAAE/</PrivateKey>
   <SingleUse>false</SingleUse>
   <PublishTrustList>false</PublishTrustList>
   <PublishBoardList>false</PublishBoardList>
   <PublishFreesite>false</PublishFreesite>
</Identity>
}}}

----

=== Finding Your Private SSK in Freetalk===
#Go to your "Own anonymous identities" page in Freetalk (http://127.0.0.1:8888/WebOfTrust/OwnIdentities) and click "Edit" for the ID you want to use. 
#Take the USK from the "Insert URI (KEEP THIS SECRET!)" field and replace the "USK" with "SSK" and strip off the "WebOfTrust/xx" stuff off the end.

For example:

----
Look for something like this:
{{{
Insert URI (KEEP THIS SECRET!): USK@YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,AQECAAE/WebOfTrust/12
}}}

And then copy it and edit it to look like this:
{{{
SSK@YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,AQECAAE/
}}}

===FMS Configuration===

By default the prototype uses the "biss.test000" FMS group.
Make sure FMS is configured to save messages to this group.

On the FMS Boards maintenance page:
http://127.0.0.1:18080/boards.htm

Search for "biss.test000" and make sure "Save Received Messages" is checked.

If you can't find the group, add it.

===Freetalk Configuration===

By default the prototype uses the "biss.test000" group. Since Freetalk requires a language code, "mul.biss.test000" can be used.

To subscribe to this board, got to your Freetalk "Select Boards" page (http://127.0.0.1:8888/Freetalk/SelectBoards) and look for "mul.biss.test000" board and click the "Subscribe" button.

If you can't find the group, add it.

Also, Freetalk does not have the NNTP server enabled by default. You can do that in the Freetalk settings page (http://127.0.0.1:8888/Freetalk/Settings) by setting the "Enable NNTP server?" option to "true" in the "Global settings" section. 

It claims that you have to restart your node for the settings to take effect, but you can just go to your Freenet plugins page and click the "Reload" button for the Freetalk plugin to make these settings take effect.
