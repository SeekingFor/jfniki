=== jfniki Specific Extensions to Creole ===
# External http links show up as hypertexted but all point to the [[ExternalLink]] Page
# CHK, SSK and USK freenet links work. e.g.:\\
  [[freenet:USK@8r-uSRcJPkAr-3v3YJR16OCx~lyV2XOKsiG4MOQQBMM,P42IgNemestUdaI7T6z3Og6P-Hi7g9U~e37R3kWGVj8,AQACAAE/freesite-HOWTO/4/|Freesite HOWTO Freesite.]]\\
  KSK links aren't allowed because they can be attacked.
# CHK, and SSK references can be used in inline images. e.g.\\
  {{freenet:SSK@0npnMrqZNKRCRoGojZV93UNHCMN-6UU3rRSAmP6jNLE,~BG-edFtdCC1cSH4O3BWdeIYa8Sw5DfyrSV-TKdO5ec,AQACAAE/fms-123/activelink.png}} \\
  USK inline images aren't allowed because they can be changed after the wikitext is submitted.\\
  KSK inline images aren't allowed because they can be changed (attacked).
# ~<<<LocalChanges>>>\\displays a list of all pages that have unsubmitted local changes.
# ~<<<TitleIndex>>>\\displays a list of all pages in the wiki.
# ~<<<RebasedChanges>>>\\displays a directory level diff between the parent and rebase versions if a rebase version is loaded.
# ~<<<ArchiveVersion>>>\\displays the 16 digit hex version of the archive the current version was loaded from.
# ~<<<ArchiveUri>>>\\displays a link to the SSK the of the archive the current version was loaded from.

=== Notes and examples from T4 Release notes ===

=== Deviations from Creole 1.0

# Nowiki blocks and spans:
#- Nowiki blocks and spans ~{{{...}}} can start and end anywhere
(within text, in lists, table cells). If }}} needs to be included
into nowiki-block it has to be escaped by ~~}}}. If nowiki block
has to end with tilde (~), insert newline after tilde; for inline
nowiki just put tilde outside nowiki block: {{{nowiki}}}~.
#- Nowiki is treated as a block if it has newline characters within it.
Block nowikis are rendered with <pre> tag, inline nowikis rendered
without any additional tags around (monospaced font can be turned on by ~##).
# Mixed lists:
#- When nesting different types of lists T4-WP requires that initial line
characters signifying lists that shall continue should match.
E.g., for T4-WP this is correct:{{{
* item a
*# item a.1
*#* item a.1.a
}}}
But the following construct doesn't work:{{{
* item a
## item a.1
*** item a.1.a
}}}
# Escaping:
#- Tilde only escapes characters that otherwise would be treated as markup.
If tilde is found in front of other characters it is treated literally: ~example.
# Extensions:
#- __Underlined__ and ##monospaced## font styles.
#- Quotes (>), indents (:), and centered paragraphs (!). These can be intermixed with lists (*#).
#- Unnumbered lists can be done with minus (-) character as well as with (*).
#- Table cells can span multiple columns (by using multiple pipes in a row: |||).
#- Double minus (--) surrounded by spaces produces – ( -- ).
#- Some HTML character entities are supported: © ® ™
— – “ ” € • · « » etc.
(and   of course).
These are defined in ##ys.wikiparser.Utils## class and can be extended.
#- ~<<<TOC>>> macro to generate table of contents based on headings in text
#- Headings are given unique generated id's to be referred from TOC, etc.
#- Simplified Mediawiki-style multiline tables ({| ... | ... |- ... | ... |}) to allow structured wiki content within cells.

=== Bold, Italic, Underlined, Monospaced ===

You can make things **bold** or //italic// or __**//both + underline//**__.

##{{{Monospaced text **no markup**}}}## or **##{{{monospaced bold text **no markup**}}}##**

=== Links ===

You can use [[internal_links|internal links]] (eg. links to your own wikipedia's tags) or [[http://www.wikicreole.org|external links]],
give the link a [[internal links|different display text]].

Free links without braces are rendered as well, like http://www.wikicreole.org/ and http://www.wikicreole.org/users/~example.


=== Horizontal Rule ===

You can use ---- to draw a line to separate the page:
----

=== Lists, Quotes, Indents ===

Unnumbered lists:
* item a
* item b
* **bold item c**

Lists can be numbered or even mixed up:
# item a
# item b
#* **bold sub item of b**
#* __underlined sub item of b__
#*# sub-sub-item 1
#*# sub-sub-item 2

> Quotes can be mixed with lists.
: ... so do indents.
:: ... at multiple levels

=== Nowiki and Escape ===

You can use block nowiki syntax if you would like do stuff like this:

{{{
Guitar Chord C:

||---|---|---|
||-0-|---|---|
||---|-0-|---|
||---|---|-0-|
||---|---|---|
}}}

... or inline nowiki: {{{** not bold **}}}.

Single character escape is done by a tilde: ~

Normal link: http://wikicreole.org/ - now same link, but escaped: ~http://wikicreole.org/ 

Normal asterisks: ~**not bold~**

A tilde escapes itself: ~~**bold**.

=== Tables ===

Tables are done like this:

|=header1||=headerl2|
|col1|col2|col3|
| can have ~| in a cell||colspan=2|
|||colspan=3|

=== MediaWiki-Style Tables ===

{|
- Can have lists within cells
|
! Can have\\centered\\paragraphs
|-
{{{
As well as
multiline
no-wiki blocks
}}}
|
| And even nested | mini-tables |
|}

=== Insert a summary ===

Wrote ~<<<TOC>>> to insert a summary here.
