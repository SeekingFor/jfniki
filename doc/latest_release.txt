I added support for inserting wiki mirror freesites from jfniki.

INSERTING:
There is a new "Insert" link at the very bottom of the page which
brings up the Freesite Insert page.

There are radio buttons to choose between USK and CHK inserts.

If you choose CHK, the site will be inserted under an CHK, which
is good for testing.

If you choose USK, the site will be inserted under the public key
corresponding to your FMS / Freetalk private key, with the human
readable site name you specify.  It should find the correct
insertion index for you.

GOTCHAS:
* This feature relies on the underlying FCP2 ClientPutComplexDir command.
  It seems pretty flaky especially for USK insertion, and especially
  when the network is overloaded.  If you need reliability stick with
  DumpWiki and jSite.

THEMES:
If you want, you can customize the the way the site is inserted by
providing a theme zip file.

The zip file MUST have the following layout:

theme/config/template.html  -- a template file like the one used for DumpWiki
theme/config/default_page.txt -- a text file with one line containing the default page name
theme/static/ -- this directory can contain any static files you like.

Here's an example theme you can download from freenet and unzip:

CHK@Vp5D8hw9sQi5EGyW6xwjB3xoSCBPkej0RJP5x6vjKWs,UhRPRMdff3EKMIt7VtzaMI7cluGWStmL7~iRYaQQ-6w,AAIC--8/test_theme.zip

GOTCHAS:
* The default_page.txt file should contain the final converted name of the
  page in the freesite, not the wiki name. It can be a static file.
  e.g. use "Front_Page.html" for the "Front_Page" wiki page.
* There are no directories in the inserted site.
  e.g. theme/static/my_file.txt in the .zip file will appear as
  USK@<line nois>/sitename/my_file.txt
* Theme .zip files must be < 128K (and should be much smaller).
* Uploaded theme .zip files must end in .zip. Only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 , '-' and '_'
  are allowed in the name part.
* Error reporting for problems with .zip files is poor so if you mess
  up the theme .zip file, you won't get much useful feedback. Sorry.

Fixed bug that was causing "Discover" to fail with an
"Error reading log: XGETTRUST NNTP request failed: 480 Identity not found" error
message on FMS. This only happened for deleted identities.

Fixed a bug in the display of '-' that was causing horizontal lines to
be rendered incorrectly on the "Discover" page.

Removed some unused files from the build. This should shrink the .jar and .zip.

Fixed bug on the "Discover" page that caused lines to be drawn incorrectly
in some cases for graphs with rebased versions.

Use .zip instead of .tgz for source release.
