I added explicit support for "Discussion" links in page headers.
The special page, "TalkPageDoesNotExist" is displayed if no talk page exists yet.

I had to modify the DumpWiki CLI client to handle the new page header format.
You need to handle a new %s for the talk page href.
See ./templates/wiki_dump_template.html for an example.
