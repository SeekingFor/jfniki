Fixed a bug in the display of '-' that was causing horizontal lines to
be rendered incorrectly on the "Discover" page.

Removed some unused files from the build. This should shrink the .jar and .zip.

Fixed bug on the "Discover" page that caused lines to be drawn incorrectly
in some cases for graphs with rebased versions.

Use .zip instead of .tgz for source release.
