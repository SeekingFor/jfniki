WARNING:
This is beta code.  I've taken reasonable precautions to make sure it is
safe, including running the Freenet content filter over the final output
to trap dangerous HTML. However, this is new code that was written fast and
hasn't been audited by *anyone*.

DON'T USE IT if violation of your anonymity would put you at risk.

ABOUT:
* jfniki is an experimental serverless wiki implementation which runs over Freenet / FMS.
* It is written in Java and has no external build dependencies except for freenet.jar.
* jfniki is INCOMPATIBLE with the existing server based python fniki implementation.
* It can run either as a standalone web app or as a Freenet Plugin.

REQUIREMENTS:
ant
java 1.5 or better
Access to a running Freenet Node and FMS daemon.
A reasonably recent version of freenet.jar

FMS CONFIGURATION:
By default the prototype uses the "biss.test000" FMS group.
Make sure FMS is configured to save messages to this group.

On the FMS Boards maintenance page:
http://127.0.0.1:18080/boards.htm

Search for "biss.test000" and make sure "Save Received Messages" is checked.

If you can't find the group, add it.

BUILD:
Copy freenet.jar into ./alien/libs

run:
ant jar

RUN STAND ALONE:
./script/jfniki.sh 8083

Look at http://127.0.0.1:8083 with your web browser.

Click on the "View" Configuration link and set the "FMS Private SSK" and "FMS name" fields.
If you want you can use the "Export" button on the Configuration page to export your
configuration to a file.

Once you've done that you can start the script with the saved configuration. i.e.:

./script/jfniki.sh path_to_your_saved_config

will start the stand alone app on the same port you used before.

RUNNING STAND ALONE ON WINDOWS:
I don't have access to a Windows machine to test on so I didn't write a .bat.

TheSeeker from FMS reports that you can run stand alone under Windows by copying freenet.jar
and jfniki.jar into the same directory and running:

java(w) -cp freenet.jar;jfniki.jar fniki.standalone.ServeHttp [jfniki.cfg|port]

RUN AS A FREENET PLUGIN:
Load the jar file from ./build/jar/jfniki.jar

Click on the "View" Configuration link and set the "FMS Private SSK" and "FMS ID" fields.

OTHER DOC:
See quickstart.txt in the doc directory (The default page when an empty wiki is displayed).

KNOWN ISSUES:
o "Cancel" sometimes fails. [WORKAROUND: load and unload the plugin / kill restart the stand alone app.]
o FMS Id displays "???" when importing config with non-default FCP host and/or port.
  [WORKAROUND: Click "Done", then click view again and the FMS Id should be correctly displayed.]
