WARNING:
This is beta code.  I've taken reasonable precautions to make sure it is
safe, including running the Freenet content filter over the final output
to trap dangerous HTML. However, this is new code that was written fast and
hasn't been audited by *anyone*.

DON'T USE IT if violation of your anonymity would put you at risk.

ABOUT:
* jfniki is an experimental serverless wiki implementation which runs over Freenet / FMS.
* It is written in Java and has no external build dependencies except for freenet.jar.
* jfniki is INCOMPATIBLE with the existing server based python fniki implementation.
* It can run either as a standalone web app or as a Freenet Plugin.

REQUIREMENTS:
ant
java 1.5 or better
Access to a running Freenet Node and FMS daemon.
A reasonably recent version of freenet.jar

FMS CONFIGURATION:
By default the prototype uses the "biss.test000" FMS group.
Make sure FMS is configured to save messages to this group.

On the FMS Boards maintenance page:
http://127.0.0.1:18080/boards.htm

Search for "biss.test000" and make sure "Save Received Messages" is checked.

If you can't find the group, add it.

BUILD:
Copy freenet.jar into ./alien/libs

run:
ant jar

RUN STAND ALONE:
./script/jfniki.sh 8083

Look at http://127.0.0.1:8083 with your web browser.

Click on the "View" Configuration link and set the "FMS Private SSK" and "FMS name" fields.
If you want you can use the "Export" button on the Configuration page to export your
configuration to a file.

Once you've done that you can start the script with the saved configuration. i.e.:

./script/jfniki.sh path_to_your_saved_config

will start the stand alone app on the same port you used before.

RUNNING STAND ALONE ON WINDOWS:
I don't have access to a Windows machine to test on so I didn't write a .bat.

TheSeeker from FMS reports that you can run stand alone under Windows by copying freenet.jar
and jfniki.jar into the same directory and running:

java(w) -cp freenet.jar;jfniki.jar fniki.standalone.ServeHttp [jfniki.cfg|port]

RUN AS A FREENET PLUGIN:
Load the jar file from ./build/jar/jfniki.jar

Click on the "View" Configuration link and set the "FMS Private SSK" and "FMS ID" fields.

OTHER DOC:
See quickstart.txt in the doc directory (The default page when an empty wiki is displayed).
It has some notes on experimental support for Freetalk implemented by sethcg.

KNOWN ISSUES:
o "Cancel" sometimes fails. [WORKAROUND: load and unload the plugin / kill restart the stand alone app.]
o FMS Id displays "???" when importing config with non-default FCP host and/or port.
  [WORKAROUND: Click "Done", then click view again and the FMS Id should be correctly displayed.]

?BUG: Saw spurious content filter trip viewing ChangeLog on freenetdocwiki. couldn't repro standalone.
      loading the wiki again made it go away?
BUG: mSecondary not reset after submit?[verified, fix it!]
BUG: am seeing sha1('') hash values for cached CHKs for re-insert code? what's up [looks ugly. not critical. punt for now.]
BUG: wikitext should use unix line terminators not DOS (+1 byte per line) [punt for now]
---
** CHORE: Fix all the places I should be using context.fillInTemplate
CHORE: Fix commented out assertion in release script.
CHORE: Fix release script to automagically truncate the latest_version file at a sentinel line.
       e.g.:__RELEASE_SCRIPT_IGNORES_PAST_THIS_LINE__
CHORE: Fix references to "library" in file headers.
CHORE: Fix references to "FMS" to reflect the fact that either Freetalk or FMS may be used.
CHORE: Add links to previous pages to release page. [encode head and date into tag?]
CHORE: Pillage code out of hg infocalypse to update infocalypse repo version in cut_release.py
CHORE: Backout the code in ArchiveManager that allows old format uris without parents.
CHORE: Get rid of output spewed to stderr.
CHORE: Fix sethcg's dump template stuff to use named variables?
CHORE: Fix crappy code: fix places where I am using signed int values from DataInputStreams to rep unsigned values.
CHORE: Fix cut_release.py to use USK insertion for site so hints are inserted.
       Write stand alone tool?
---
IDEA: Make Freetalk configuration keys work like fms configuration? i.e. no need for public key.
IDEA:fix version hash generation code to ignore the nym part of the URL
     i.e. version inserted by different nyms with the same info
     after the slash are CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY VERIFIED to be the same version.
     [Not sure about this. How do you determine attribution then?] 

IDEA: FMS and FreeTalk "Wizard" tools. To AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT PRIVATE KEYS FROM YOUR LOCAL fproxy/FMS instance.
      [I wrote a quick and dirty test to do this for FreetTalk. I don't want to put that much time into it
       because I'm afraid it would be contrued as an attack, and the pages I'm scraping disabled.]
IDEA: 0) Make a new KIND_AM_CHAIN_HEAD external key key type and save the archive manifest hash
      corresponding to parent / rebase links in ExternalRefs.
      1) Fix the external link format to use it instead of the sha1 of the contents[thats what I should have done in the first place]
      2) Fix all the places that the change above ripples through (ui, validation, auditing, new validation to make sure amch and uri match)
      3) Update the CLI client to be able to "checkout" by amch, then it should be possible to reinsert blocks for any version
         if you have the links locally cached.
      4) It should be possible to regenerate topkey for any version.
      5) It should be possible to traverse history w/o hitting fn.

**IDEA: Fix automatic "freenet:..." link detection.  legit scheme://rest parsing is
        built into creole parser, but freenet links don't use a standard scheme url. grrrrrr...
        0) Preprocess? 1) hack creole parser [Not sure this is worth it.]
[PUNT: SFA provided toadlet code.] **IDEA: Toadlet based plugin that redirects to
                                   jfniki (i.e. to get on menu) [not sure this is possible]
*IDEA: Support links to other wikis. e.g.:b fniki://nntp/group/name[/SSK@some_version]
      [Not quite. Should be able to support mutliple transports (fms, ft, freemail?, fproxy usk?) in same url]
      [See notes below on ft fms interop. one NNTP to rule them all]
IDEA: Freetalk vs Freenet interop
      0) Group naming convention. anythingbutmul.foo.bar.baz -> mul.anythingbutmul.foo.bar.baz in freetalk
      1) fniki://groupname/wikiname/[optional SSK] -- same for both. Freetalk nntp code prefixes mul. to group
      2) In config UI. add freetalk config and enable checkboxes for freeetalk and fms
      3) Convention or config to choose which private key is used for SSK insertion.
      Hmmm... not sure if people would use this feature because of the correlation of ids.
IDEA: Add permenant static help page, with quickstart page. Clean up display of empty wiki.
IDEA: Use magic pages for extra header and footers. Add options to disable them in config. emergency link on perm footer
      Completely replace top footer?
IDEA: I KAN HAZ JAVA TEMPLATE ENGIN?
       http://www.source-code.biz/MiniTemplator/

IDEA: <<<SaidBy|public_key|sig>>> -- macro which allows you to drop a cryptographically signed block of text into a page
      0) need to read up on crypto
      1) Is it possible to implement block level macros with t4?
      Intent: signed discussion entries, changlog entries
IDEA: Headers / Footers (not sure how to implement yet. macros? <<<header>>> possibly referencing <<<this_page>>>) [From two different nyms]
IDEA: write code to 0) compile a list of referenced USKS and 1) update them to the latest versions.

IDEA: shrink blocks by using a token map?  use short token in binary rep, fixup to full 20byte hash on read / write?
IDEA: Caching in FreenetIO
      Make LinkCache and interface
      FreenetLinkCache extends LinkCache
        SSK -> topkey byte[] hash
        CHK -> CHK content SHA1
        CHK content SHA1 ->  CHK
        void cacheTopKey(SSK, InputStream)
        FreenetTopKey getTopKey(ssk)
        SHA1 cacheBlock(CHK, InputStream)
        boolean isCached(CHK)


IDEA: Ditch human readable name <--> SSK fixup and generate arbitrary names from
      SSK public key hash (== big number). <n_first>*<m_middle>*<o_last> == big number
      let n = 1000, m = 1000,  o == 1000 => ???? [NOT QUITE. LOOK UP Combinatorics. USABILITY QUESTIONABLE]
      [I think zwister might be working on something similar. rtfs his source before coding this from scratch.]

IDEA: Wikibot ng. Just uses its FMS trust info to decide which version is the latest and
      send a "Stake" biss message for it.

08d1b85d8ddd: IDEA: Pillage glog graph drawing code from hg to improve discover versions UI
      from  http://selenic.com/repo/hg-stable/file/4ec34de8bbb1/hgext/graphlog.py
      ISSUES:
      0) It doesn't draw arbitary DAGs, only DAGS that could have reasonably constructed
         from an ORDERED sequence of commits.
      1) I implemented construction of DAGS from an unsorted list of (child, parent) pairs
         BUT it depends CRITICALLY on:
         a) being able to find the root nodes. (i.e. the nodes for which no parents are available).
         b) being able to find the child nodes. (i.e. nodes without children)
      2) This theoretically leaves the drawing code vulnerable to attack.
         ATTACK: Create a cycle so that there are no root or child nodes.
         PUNT: Don't worry about it. Attacker has to break SHA1 to create a cycle
               because of the way the version is string is generated.
